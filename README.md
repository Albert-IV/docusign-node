[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## THIS REPO IS DEPRECIATED!

The `docusign-node` npm package has been unpublished in favor of the updated [`docusign`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusign) package.  You can find the GitHub repo [here.](https://github.com/docusign/docusign-node-client)

If you see errors in your program, you should be able to swap out for the `docusign` package without any issues.

I have published this as a package to ensure nothing nefarious can happen in the future.
